Ways to implement Bootstrap:

i) CDN link directly
ii) Download the bootstrap zip file.
iii) Using Node Package Manager (npm)

When you are working with frameworks, we generally have the
npm install command. At the same time, we see that the bootstrap
files are downloaded & they are used at the development server.
But when it goes to the production server, it is always the
cdn, which works in the best way.
